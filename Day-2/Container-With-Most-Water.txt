#intution
use two-pointers. Set one pointer to the left and one to the right of the array. Always move the pointer that points to the lower line.

public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int left = 0, right = n-1;
        int A = INT_MIN;

        while(left<right){
            if(height[left]<height[right]){
                A = max(A, height[left] * (right-left));
                left++;
            } else{
                A = max(A, height[right] * (right-left));
                right--;
